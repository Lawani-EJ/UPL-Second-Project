#### **Project Description:**  
This project is a simple HTML survey form designed for employees to submit their interests and preferences. It includes a variety of form elements such as text inputs, text areas, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdown menus. This was created during my student IT internship at **Upperlink Limited**, where I was learning the basics of web development and working with forms as a beginner.

#### **Purpose of the Project:**  
This project served as an introduction to:
1. **HTML Form Basics**: Understanding how forms work and how to collect user input.
2. **Form Elements**: Learning about different input types such as text, textarea, radio buttons, checkboxes, and dropdowns.
3. **Action Attribute**: Understanding how the `action` attribute directs form submissions to a specific URL.
4. **Web Development Fundamentals**: Gaining hands-on experience in structuring and styling basic web pages.

#### **Key Code Concepts Learned:**
1. **Form Tag and Attributes**:
   - `action`: Specifies where the form data will be submitted.
   - `method`: Determines how the form data is sent (POST/GET).
2. **Text Input Fields**: For capturing user details.
3. **Text Areas**: For allowing users to input multiline text.
4. **Radio Buttons**: For selecting one option out of multiple choices.
5. **Checkboxes**: For selecting multiple options.
6. **Dropdown Menus**: For a list of predefined options.
7. **Submit Button**: Sending user-entered data to the specified `action` URL.

#### **Challenges Faced:**
- Understanding how form elements interact with the `action` URL.
- Aligning form elements properly within the page.
- Ensuring a basic understanding of HTML syntax and attributes.

---

#### **Future Improvements:**  
- Add validation to ensure all required fields are completed before submission.
- Integrate CSS for better design and usability.
- Add JavaScript for real-time feedback (e.g., field validation or dynamic dropdown menus).
- Store user input in a database or process it with a backend system.
